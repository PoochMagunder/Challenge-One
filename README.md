# <Challenge-One>

## Description

This was the first of many class challenges that we will be conducting.

This webpage is designed to show you different information about the topics of "Search Engine Optimization", 
"Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing".

Working on this website has taught me a lot about website accessibility standards. I have had to learn about the use and proper flow of HTML semantic elements. I've also learnt a lot about placing code in proper sequential order.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
