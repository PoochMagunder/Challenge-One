# <Challenge-One>

## Description

This was the first of many class challenges that we will be conducting.

This webpage is designed to show you different information about the topics of "Search Engine Optimization", 
"Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing".

Working on this website has taught me a lot about website accessibility standards. I have had to learn about the use and proper flow of HTML semantic elements. I've also learnt a lot about placing code in proper sequential order.
